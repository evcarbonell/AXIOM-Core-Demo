## Overview

This repository provides a **safe, non-proprietary reference** implementation of the **Core AI Framework** for demonstration purposes.  

The framework demonstrates a **cognitive loop** designed for long-horizon reasoning:

User Input → Planner → LLM Reasoning → Reflection → Memory Update → Persona-Constrained Identity Continuity


This demo highlights:

- **Persona-based identity anchoring**
- **Simulated planning and reasoning**
- **Structured memory logging (episodic & semantic)**
- **Reference Core module only — no proprietary code exposed**

---

## Features

- Safe, public reference of the Core orchestrator
- Immutable persona definition
- Simulated cognition loop:
  - Planning
  - LLM reasoning
  - Reflection and memory update
- Episodic and semantic memory trace logging
- Demo interface via `demo_simulation.py`
- PrettyTable summary of command outputs

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [PrettyTable](https://pypi.org/project/prettytable/)

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the demo simulation:

python demo_simulation.py

Example output includes:

Generated plan for each command

Simulated LLM response

Reflection summary

Updated episodic & semantic memory

Summary table of all demo commands

Memory traces are saved to core_memory_log.jsonl for auditability.
